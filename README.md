*Best Final Project, Product Design I (Instructor Rated)*

## ASK

Students have to stay up til the wee hours of the morning, more often than not. Mental health issues are pervasive and people don’t receive enough sleep — when they do, it isn’t restful. We looked to redesign a product centered around their behaviors rather than fixing the behavior.

## INSIGHT

The common platform for working late is the computer. These and the lights around you mimic daytime, so your body doesn’t start it’s winding down process. Blue light filters (such as f.lux) help block the spectrum of light your body recognizes as daylight, but only on computers.

## SOLUTION

We redesigned the student lamp. LiteOwl sticks on walls and features voice control (Google Speech API), a long wavelength mode for softer lighting, and even a party mode (alternating colors of LEDs). We know you college students love a party.

# Prerequisites:

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* You have installed the latest versions of Python (this was built on Python 3.8) on a Raspberry-Pi (Wi-Fi enabled with updated OS) and have a working Wi-Fi connection. 
* Any functioning OS that can run all of the above.
* Sufficient hardware (USB microphone, lights/LEDs, RPi).
* You have read this guide.

## Execution:

1. Set up hardware as described in the project details. Succinctly, the USB microphone should be plugged into the RPi and the lights should be connected directly or indirectly to the GPIO pins you select.
2. Obtain your hardware specifications and substitute values in Recording.py and LiteOwlRun.py e.g. sammpling rate. 
3. Test Google Speech API connection for success in APITest.py.
4. Run LiteOwlRun.py!
