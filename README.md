#ASK

Students have to stay up til the wee hours of the morning, more often than not. Mental health issues are pervasive and people don’t receive enough sleep — when they do, it isn’t restful. We looked to redesign a product centered around their behaviors rather than fixing the behavior.

#INSIGHT

The common platform for working late is the computer. These and the lights around you mimic daytime, so your body doesn’t start it’s winding down process. Blue light filters (such as f.lux) help block the spectrum of light your body recognizes as daylight, but only on computers.

#SOLUTION

We redesigned the student lamp. LiteOwl sticks on walls and features voice control (Google Speech API), a long wavelength mode for softer lighting, and even a party mode (alternating colors of LEDs). We know you college students love a party.
